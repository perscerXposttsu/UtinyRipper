Kenneth Anderson was a remarkable man who lived a life of adventure and passion. He was born in 1910 in India to a Scottish family that had settled there for six generations. He was fascinated by the wildlife and the culture of India, especially the southern regions of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. He spent most of his free time exploring the jungles, tracking down man-eating animals, rescuing villagers from danger, and making friends with the local tribes. He also wrote about his experiences in a series of books that are considered classics of hunting literature and natural history.
 
Anderson's books are not only thrilling accounts of his encounters with tigers, leopards, panthers, bears, elephants and other creatures, but also rich descriptions of the flora and fauna of the Indian forests. He had a deep respect and love for nature and its inhabitants, and often expressed his concern for their conservation and protection. He also had a keen interest in the folklore, customs and beliefs of the people who lived in harmony with the jungle. He wrote with humor, compassion and honesty, capturing the beauty and mystery of the wild.
 
Anderson wrote nine books in total, starting with Nine Man-Eaters and One Rogue in 1954 and ending with Jungles Long Ago in 1976. Some of his most popular books are The Black Panther of Sivanipalli, The Call of the Man-Eater, The Tiger Roars and Tales from the Indian Jungle. His books have been translated into several languages and have inspired generations of readers and hunters. His son Donald Anderson also followed his footsteps and became a hunter and writer. Kenneth Anderson died of cancer in 1974 at the age of 64.

India is one of the 17 megadiverse countries in the world, hosting about 8% of the global biodiversity. It has four biodiversity hotspots: the Himalayas, the Western Ghats, the Indo-Burma region and the Sundaland. It is also home to more than 500 wildlife sanctuaries and 100 national parks that protect various species of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish and plants. Some of the flagship species of India are the Bengal tiger, the Asiatic lion, the Indian elephant, the one-horned rhinoceros, the snow leopard and the Gangetic dolphin.
 
However, India also faces many challenges in conserving its wildlife and natural resources. Some of these are habitat loss and fragmentation due to deforestation, mining, agriculture and urbanization; poaching and illegal wildlife trade for fur, horns, ivory, skins and body parts; human-wildlife conflict due to crop raiding, livestock predation and attacks on humans; climate change and its impacts on ecosystems and species; invasive species and diseases that threaten native biodiversity; and lack of awareness and participation among local communities and stakeholders.
 
To address these challenges, India has taken various initiatives and measures to conserve its wildlife and environment. Some of these are:
 
- The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 which provides for the protection of wild animals, birds and plants and their habitats. It also establishes a network of protected areas such as national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, tiger reserves and biosphere reserves.
- The Project Tiger, launched in 1973 to conserve the Bengal tiger and its habitat. It has resulted in increasing the tiger population from 1,411 in 2006 to 2,967 in 2018.
- The Project Elephant, launched in 1992 to protect the Asian elephant and its habitat. It aims to prevent poaching and illegal trade of elephants and their products; mitigate human-elephant conflict; promote research and monitoring; and create awareness among people.
- The National Wildlife Action Plan (NWAP), formulated in 1983 and revised in 2002 and 2017. It provides a framework for wildlife conservation in India based on scientific principles, participatory approaches and sustainable development.
- The National Biodiversity Authority (NBA), established in 2003 under the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. It regulates access to biological resources and associated traditional knowledge; promotes conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity; and facilitates benefit-sharing with local communities.

These are some of the efforts that India has made to conserve its wildlife and natural heritage. However, there is still a lot of scope for improvement and collaboration among various stakeholders such as government agencies, NGOs, research institutions, private sector, media and civil society. Together, we can ensure that India's wildlife thrives for generations to come.
